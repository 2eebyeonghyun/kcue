                                Korea's elementary and secondary school system follows a 6+3+3 model and consists of 6 years of elementary education (age 6-12, elementary school), 3 years of lower secondary education (age 12-15, middle school), and 3 years of upper secondary education (age 15-18, high school). A total of 9 years of compulsory education from elementary school to middle school education is free, and high school education is not compulsory, but is provided free. Elementary and secondary schools in Korea must meet the establishment standards prescribed by Presidential Decree, such as facilities and equipment. Schools are classified into national schools, public schools, and private schools according to the founding entities. The Minister of Education determines basic matters on standards and details of the curricula and the Superintendent of an Office of Education may determine the standards and deails thereof according to actual circumstances of a region within the scope of the curricula determined by the Minister of Education.

                                Korea has four types of high schools: general high schools, special-purpose high schools, specialized high schools, autonomous high schools. Despite the different school types, all high school graduates receive the same level qualification. In addition, a person who has not graduated high school but has passed a high school equivalency examination is deemed to have an academic background equivalent to that of a high school graduate in entering a school of higher grade.
